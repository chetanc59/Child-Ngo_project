    <h5 style="color:gray;">FROM PATNA TO PERU (AND BACK!)</h5><br>
<span>
 My name is Arjun and I have been a part of the Program Management Group at LET'S HELP FOUNDATION. Our team is at a rather interesting niche in the organization – we interact with donors and manage those relationships, while also working with and supporting field teams on program planning and implementation.<br><br>

My two years at LET'S HELP FOUNDATION have been a rollercoaster. From spending hours on train stations to eating guinea pigs in Peru to conducting elections in a village in Uttar Pradesh, LET'S HELP FOUNDATION has exposed me to a range of experiences that I could never have imagined. As I look back at my time in the organization, while there have been (plenty of!) moments of frustration, I would not have had it any other way.<br><br>

I landed in Patna on a warm October night and caught a train to a district called Jamui on the edge of the state. The purpose of my trip was to visit a cluster of villages where local leaders had taken the initiative to work on children’s learning.<br><br>

I met the cluster head with Gunjan (the LET'S HELP FOUNDATION staff member leading the initiative), and asked him what he would do if LET'S HELP FOUNDATION teams moved on from that area. He responded that they would manage on their own and that he would be that area’s Gunjan. This completely blew me away. Later, I sat under the stars talking to villagers about their aspirations for children’s learning. Their sheer enthusiasm and passion is forever ingrained in my memory.<br><br>

    <h5 style="color:gray;">WHAT MAKES LET'S HELP FOUNDATION CLICK</h5><br>
<span>
 I gaze at a book called In Search of Excellence on my table, written by two ex-McKinsey consultants on what makes great ‘corporations’ click and I’m left in awe as to how LET'S HELP FOUNDATION, an NGO, has so intuitively, over and over again for the better part of the last two decades, managed to create an environment where everything just clicks.<br><br>
 Around this time last year, I knew little about the development sector. I’d worked for two years in a consulting firm and was ready to apply my obligation to dissent to a bigger context. Tired of castigating our politicians during after-work parties, I decided it was vital for me to get a sense of how things worked on the ground.<br><br>

Humble Beginnings<br><br>

When I joined in October 2020, I was fortunate enough to be trusted with LET'S HELP FOUNDATION'S flagship program, called Read India. I was told I’d be collaborating with more than 40 people from 10 states across India, which at the time seemed quite overwhelming! As I spent time with state-level MME teams, I realized how much effort LET'S HELP FOUNDATION had put in to cultivate a strong cadre of leaders in every state, an achievement few NGOs can boast of today. Data is often conveniently left out of the conversation in the social sector, yet here I was in an environment where people close to the field were discussing how our intervention could be more effective if some additional indicators were added to our monitoring formats1. <br><br>

    <h5 style="color:gray;">THE MAGIC OF PRATHAM</h5><br>
<span>
 My journey with LET'S HELP FOUNDATION started in May of 2021, and although it has been some time now, LET'S HELP FOUNDATION still makes every day feel anew. LET'S HELP FOUNDATION was my first job out of university, so I was eager to absorb as well as apply my psychology degree in the real world.<br><br>

Over time, LET'S HELP FOUNDATION has gifted me with the opportunity to work in various capacities. I started in the People Development Unit, where I contributed to the creation of capacity building programs for people within LET'S HELP FOUNDATION. Most importantly, this first position taught be that training can be a ‘tool for change’. As I gained experience, I began creating content and training people in conducting Life Skills sessions for adolescents, youth and adults.<br><br>

With the learnings from the aforementioned experiences, I was provided a platform to lead a girls’ education program working with Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalays (KGBVs). KGBVs are residential schools established for girls for girls in Upper primary grades in economically and socially backward blocks of the country. LET'S HELP FOUNDATION's partnership with KGBVs is in three states: Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand. Working in these three geographies gives me immense satisfaction and a constant thirst to learn and then concretize my learning. Be it seeing the KGBV girls speak confidently about a Science experiment they learnt, hearing the stories of friendship and collaboration with teachers and wardens or watching the way my own team of 50 women is evolving in the process -- everything has been extremely fulfilling.<br><br>
